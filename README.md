# 3D-printable model of Paul Giguere's 3D periodic table of the elements

In 1966, Canadian chemist [Paul-Antoine Giguère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul-Antoine_Giguère) published a three-dimensional version of the Periodic Table of the Elements.[^1]

 I wondered if anyone had made a 3D-printable version of Giguère's periodic table and couldn't find one, so I made this using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org).  Printed successfully on my Ender 3 using 20% infill and Raft build plate adhesion.
